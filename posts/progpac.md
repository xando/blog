# I wrote a game, a really simple one

I think some of us, get in to programming thanks to computer games, and probably some of us 
As probably many programmers I had an idea that that once I will be writing games, and this will be fun and awesome. 
I was driven by this idea by some part of my life at the Uni. Either I was not enough motivated to become one, or hadn't enough luck, but I'm not writing games today. 
But still this idea of writing games stayed in my head. So I decided to write my game. The game is available at [progpac.com](http://progpac.com). But let me explain more.


## Progpac the game


The idea from the game is not entirely original I took it from other Game, which was a part of Imagine Cup 2009 (I think). The game was called Herbert. You can find more about Herbert here if you are interest. The main idea for the game was to use simple language to solve puzzles.
